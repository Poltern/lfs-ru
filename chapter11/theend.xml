  <para>Well done! The new LFS system is installed! We wish you much
  success with your shiny new custom-built Linux system.</para>

  <para>It may be a good idea to create an
  <filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename> file. By having this file, it is very
  easy for you (and for us if you need to ask for help at some point) to find
  out which LFS version is installed on the system. Create this file by
  running:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo &version; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>

  <para>Two files describing the installed system may be used by packages that
  can be installed on the system later, either in binary form or by building
  them.</para>

  <para>The first one shows the status of your
  new system with respect to the Linux Standards Base (LSB).  To create
  this file, run:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/lsb-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
DISTRIB_ID="Linux From Scratch"
DISTRIB_RELEASE="&version;"
DISTRIB_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Linux From Scratch"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>The second one contains roughly the same information, and is used
  by systemd and some graphical desktop environments.  To create
  this file, run:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/os-release &lt;&lt; "EOF"
NAME="Linux From Scratch"
VERSION="&version;"
ID=lfs
PRETTY_NAME="Linux From Scratch &version;"
VERSION_CODENAME="&lt;your name here&gt;"
EOF</userinput></screen>

  <para>Be sure to put some sort of customization for the fields
  'DISTRIB_CODENAME' and 'VERSION_CODENAME' to make the system uniquely
  yours.</para>
