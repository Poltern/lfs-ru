commit 0c9707142465610f0e22745a22bf8c71850cef49
Author: Karl Berry <karl@freefriends.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 19 22:03:22 2024 +0000

    (%opts): create the generically-named output files as copies by default.
    (@cmdline_options): allow -no-copy.
    (help): document.
    
    
    git-svn-id: svn://tug.org/texlive/trunk@70707 c570f23f-e606-0410-a88d-b1316a301751

That was done to simplify the process (windows has always used copy) and will likely
make the installed sizes somewhat bigger.

There is an option \-\-no-copy for updmap.pl, unclear if that can be used here,
and it might have been removed by next year. -->

    <title>Общая информация о TeX Live and its installer</title>

    <para>
      The <application>TeX Live</application> package is a comprehensive
      TeX document production system.  It includes TeX, LaTeX2e, LuaLaTeX,
      Metafont, MetaPost, BibTeX and many other programs; an extensive
      collection of macros, fonts and documentation; and support for
      typesetting in many different scripts from around the world.
    </para>

    <para>
      This page is for people who wish to use the binary installer to
      provide the programs, the scripts, and a lot of supporting files and
      documentation.  The installer is updated frequently, so any published
      md5sum will soon be out of date.  Newer versions of the
      installer are expected to work with these instructions, for so long as
      they install to a
      <filename class="directory">&texlive-year;/</filename> directory.
    </para>

    <para>
      There are two reasons why you may wish to install the binaries in BLFS:
      either you need a smaller install (e.g. at a minimum plain TeX without
      LaTeX, ConTeXt, etc), or you wish to use <command>tlmgr</command> to
      get updates whilst this version is supported (typically, until March of
      the year after it was released). For the latter, you might prefer to
      install in your <filename class="directory">/home</filename> directory
      as an unprivileged user, and to then make corresponding changes to the
      PATH in your <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> or equivalent.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        If you wish to use ConTeXt with <command>luametatex</command> (most of
        the old MKII and MKIV code was removed from TeX Live 2023 by the ConTeXt
        developer), using the binary is probably the easiest option. The source
        no-longer ships with TeX Live and is poorly adapted to building with
        systems except those running Mac and Windows. See comments 1 to 5 of
        <ulink url="&blfs-ticket-root;17823">#17823</ulink>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <!-- editors: latex-test-20240320.tar.xz at ~/ken/tex-testfiles and the
    ABOUT.pdf now deal with specifying which collections are needed when using
    binary texlive. Please do not sign off this package without at least
    testing asy to ensure that the symlinks are as needed. Please also be aware
    that removing a collection might leave huge backups in tlpkg/backups -->

    <title>Binary Installation of TeX Live</title>

    <para>
      The <application>TeX Live</application> set of programs with its
      supporting documents, fonts, and utilities is very large.  The upstream
      maintainers recommend placing all files in a single directory structure.
      BLFS recommends <filename class='directory'>/opt/texlive</filename>.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
       If you have chosen to install the binary as a normal user, the directory
       for the prefix needs to be writable by that user.  The
       <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user can chown
       <filename class="directory">/opt/texlive/2024</filename> to that
       user before the user starts the install.<!-- Problem was reported on
       texlive list, at least ls-R was involved and maybe other files,
       suggestion was to remove, chown prefix, reinstall. --> If any later
       change in that directory is made by the <systemitem
       class="username">root</systemitem> user <emphasis>that will change the
       ownership</emphasis> which breaks usage by normal users.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      As with any other package, unpack the installer and change into its
      directory, <filename class='directory'>
        install-tl-&lt;CCYYMMDD&gt;</filename>.
      This directory name changes when the installer is updated, so replace
      &lt;CCYYMMDD&gt; by the correct directory name.

      <para>
        The distribution binaries installed below may use static linking
        for general linux system libraries.  Additional libraries or
        interpreters as specified in the dependencies section do not need to
        be present during the install, but the programs that need them will
        not run until their specific dependencies have been installed.

    <!-- please keep something like this in the future -->
      <para>
        With all contributed binary software, there may be a mismatch between
        the builder's toolchain and your hardware.  In most of TeX this will
        probably not matter, but in uncommon corner cases you might hit
        problems. For example, if your x86_64 processor does not support 3dnowext or
        3dnow, the 2014-06-28 binary failed in conTeXt when running LuaTeX,
        although lualatex worked, as did the i686 binaries on the same
        machine. In such cases, the easiest solution is to install texlive
        from source. Similarly, the x86_64 binary version of
        <command>asy</command> runs very slowly when creating 3-D diagrams.

      This command is interactive and allows selection or modification of
      platform, packages, directories, and other options. The full installation
      scheme will require about 4.9 gigabytes of disk space. The time to
      complete the download will depend on your internet connection speed
      and the number of packages selected.
