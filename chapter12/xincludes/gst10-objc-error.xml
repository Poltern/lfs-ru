    <!-- As part of their move to Meson, the GStreamer developers included a
         check for an ObjC compiler, since their primary user other than Linux
         is macOS. -->
    <note><para>If you do not have an Objective-C compiler installed, the
    build system for this package will emit a warning about a failed sanity
    check. This is harmless, and it is safe to continue.</para></note>
