    <para><option>--enable-gtk-doc</option>: This parameter is normally
    used if <application>GTK-Doc</application> is installed and you wish
    to rebuild and install the API documentation. It is broken for
    this package due to the use of a long deprecated gtk-doc program
    that is no longer available.</para>
