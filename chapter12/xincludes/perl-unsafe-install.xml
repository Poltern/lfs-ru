    <!-- typically, these modules fail to reference inc::Module::Install
     when perl Makefile.PL is run, AND they are OLD, so any update is
     likely to change them to using the standard install -->
    <para>
      This module uses the 'unsafe' build and installation instructions
      (In <application>perl-5.26.0</application> the use of the current
      directory in <literal>@INC</literal> was removed for security
      reasons and this module has not been updated) :

<screen><userinput>PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1 perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp;
make             &amp;&amp;
make test</userinput></screen>

      Now, as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user:

<screen role="root"><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>

    </para>
