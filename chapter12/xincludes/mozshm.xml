    <!-- to go inside a NOTE on mozilla packages which need shm
         mounted when configured or similar in chroot.
         Unfortunately, the DTD says an xinclude can only include
         one paragraph.

         We now have exactly one paragraph, git blame this line for
         details.                                             -->

    <para>
      If you are compiling this package in chroot you must
      ensure that <filename>/dev/shm</filename> is mounted. If you do not
      do this, the <application>Python</application> configuration will fail
      with a traceback report referencing
      <filename>/usr/lib/pythonN.N/multiprocessing/synchronize.py</filename>.
      As the &root; user, run:

<screen role="nodump"><userinput>mountpoint -q /dev/shm || mount -t tmpfs devshm /dev/shm</userinput></screen>
