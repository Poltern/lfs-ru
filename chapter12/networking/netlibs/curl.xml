      The <application>cURL</application> package contains an utility
      and a library used for transferring files with URL syntax to any of
      the following protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP,
      HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTSP, SMB, SMBS,
      SMTP, SMPTS, TELNET, and TFTP. Its ability to both download
      and upload files can be incorporated into other programs to support
      functions like streaming media.

    2017-10-29 - bdubbs
    For version 7.56.1 I had a lot of test failures which included long
    timeouts.  Could not determine the cause of the timeouts or failures,
    but I was missing c-ares, MIT Kerberos, ldap, samba, and the six
    external packages.

    2017-12-01 - bdubbs
    Still a lot of test failures.  I did have c-ares, Kerberos, and ldap
    installed this time.  Best guess is that servers are not available.

    2018-08-01 - renodr
    No test failures, but I didn't have any of the optional dependencies except
    for c-ares and libidn2. I might re-run this test suite before release with
    all of the optional deps, but right now, it isn't a priority - rather
    the security fix is.
-->

    <para>
       To run the test suite, issue: <command>make test</command>.
       <!--One test, <filename>1477</filename>, is known to fail due to 
       a missing file in the curl tarball.--> Some tests are flaky, 
       so if some tests have failed it's possible to
       run a test again with: <command>(cd tests; ./runtests.pl
       <replaceable>&lt;test ID&gt;</replaceable>)</command> (the ID of
       failed tests are shown in the <quote><computeroutput>These test cases
       failed:</computeroutput></quote> message). If you run the tests after
       the package has been installed, some tests may fail because the man
       pages were deleted by the 'find' command in the installation instructions
       below.

<!-- Two (of 857) tests
fail for unknown reasons, and all tests fail is valgrind is installed. Moving
valgrind out of $PATH is recommended if you wish to run the test suite while
it is installed.

         and no. I don't have smb - so commenting the rest of this:
      To run the test suite, issue: <command>make test</command>. Many tests
      may fail that depend on optional dependencies that may not be installed
      or upstream servers that may not be available, especially for tests
      numbered 700 and above.
      Test time may be significantly increase due to hanging tests that fail.

I only have c-ares and libidn2 installed, I will likely try before release
with all optional dependencies in the book installed.

=========
7.61.1 NOTE: The test suite is extremely noisy, complaining about verification errors.
It's possible this is due to openssl-1.1.1, BUT 79/79 tests report as 100% OK. I had
c-ares, libpsl, and libidn1/2 installed. - Doug
