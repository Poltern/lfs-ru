  <title>Connecting to a Network</title>

  <para>
    The LFS book covers setting up networking by connecting to a LAN
  with a static IP address. There are other methods used to obtain an IP
  address and connect to a LAN and other networks (such as the Internet).
  The most popular methods (DHCP and PPP) are covered in this chapter.</para>

  <para>
    DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a protocol used
    by many sites to automatically provide information such as IP addresses,
    subnet masks and routing information to computers.  If your network uses
    DHCP, you will need a DHCP client in order to connect to it.

<!-- we do not include ppp
  <para>
    PPP stands for Point-to-Point Protocol. It is a data link protocol
    commonly used for establishing authenticated IP connections over
    a phone line with a modem, or over radio waves with a cellular phone. There
    is also a variant (PPPoE) that works over Ethernet and is used by cable
    providers to authenticate the Internet connections.
