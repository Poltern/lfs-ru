  <title>Security</title>

  <para>
    Security takes many forms in a computing environment. After some
    initial discussion, this chapter
    gives examples of three different types of security: access, prevention
    and detection.
  </para>

  <para>
    Access for users is usually handled by <command>login</command> or an
    application designed to handle the login function. In this chapter, we show
    how to enhance <command>login</command> by setting policies with
    <application>PAM</application> modules.  Access via networks can also be
    secured by policies set by <application>iptables</application>, commonly
    referred to as a firewall. The Network Security Services (NSS) and
    Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) libraries can be installed and shared
    among the many applications requiring them. For applications that don't
    offer the best security, you can use the
    <application>Stunnel</application> package to wrap an application daemon
    inside an SSL tunnel.
  </para>

  <para>
    Prevention of breaches, like a trojan, are assisted by applications like
    <application>GnuPG</application>, specifically the ability to confirm
    signed packages, which recognizes modifications of the tarball
    after the packager creates it.
  </para>

  <para>
    Finally, we touch on detection with a package that stores "signatures"
    of critical files (defined by the administrator) and then regenerates those
    "signatures" and compares for files that have been changed.
  </para>
